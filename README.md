## Welcome to my GitHub portfolio!

Feel free to look around and explore my projects. 

ðŸ’Š I recently completed a bioinformatics project that predicts drug potency based on drug-mutation combinations.

ðŸ”¬ I am currently working on building a CNN to improve accuracy of colon cancer detection using histopathological images. 

ðŸ”‹ I am also exploring electric vehicle charging station data to identify holes in the charging network coverage area.
