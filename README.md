# ðŸ‘¨ Patrick Kirby Jr.

## Welcome to my GitHub portfolio!

Feel free to look around and explore my projects. 

ðŸ’Š I recently completed a [bioinformatics project](https://github.com/patrickkirbyjr/Drug-Potency-Predictor) that predicts drug potency based on drug-mutation combinations.

ðŸ”¬ I am currently working on building a [CNN](https://github.com/patrickkirbyjr/Colon-Cancer-CNN) to improve accuracy of colon cancer detection using histopathological images. 

ðŸ”‹ I am also exploring electric vehicle charging station data to identify holes in the charging network coverage area in the United States.
