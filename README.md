## 🚀 Featured Projects

### 💊 [Drug Potency Prediction Engine](https://github.com/patrickkirbyjr/Drug-Potency-Predictor)
**Focus:** Bioinformatics & Cheminformatics  
**Tech Stack:** Python, Gradio, Scikit-learn

* **Objective:** Built a machine learning pipeline to predict IC50 values (drug potency) based on chemical structure and genomic features.
* **Methodology:** Utilized **SMILES** strings and **Morgan fingerprints** for feature engineering to accurately represent molecular structures for regression modeling.
* **Outcome:** Deployed a user-friendly web interface via **Gradio** allowing users to input chemical data and receive real-time potency predictions.

### 📊 **Longitudinal STEM Performance Analysis**
**Focus:** Educational Data Mining & Statistics  
**Tech Stack:** Python, Pandas, SciPy, Matplotlib

* **Objective:** Analyzed anonymized student performance data (2023–2025) to determine the impact of class scheduling and class size on academic outcomes.
* **Methodology:** Conducted rigorous hypothesis testing, including **Shapiro-Wilk** for normality checks and **Kruskal-Wallis** tests to identify statistically significant differences between student cohorts.
* **Outcome:** Provided data-driven insights into how non-cognitive factors (time of day, cohort size) influence student success rates in STEM.

### 🔋 [Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Gap Analysis](https://github.com/patrickkirbyjr/ev-infrastructure-analysis)
**Focus:** Geospatial Analysis  
**Tech Stack:** R, Data Visualization

* **Objective:** Identified critical gaps in the current US electric vehicle charging network.
* **Methodology:** Analyzed geographic distributions of charging stations against population and usage metrics to rank states by infrastructure deficiency.
* **Outcome:** Produced a ranked list of "underbuilt" states to highlight high-priority areas for future infrastructure development.

## 🚧 Coming Soon / In Progress

### 🏥 **Clinical Trial Data Analysis (R)**
* **Focus:** CDISC Standards & Clinical Reporting
* **Objective:** A demonstration of CDISC-compliant analysis of clinical trial datasets using **R** and the **Tidyverse**, focusing on regulatory-standard reporting and data visualization.
