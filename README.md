# Welcome, friend!

Have a seat and stay a while. I'd love to show you some of my recent projects. Each one was inspired by one of my passions.

🔋 Electric vehicles are getting really good. As a result, I see more and more EVs on the road these days. It occurred to me that the charging infrastructure in the United States needs some work to support the transition from internal combustion to fully electric vehicles. My [charging network coverage](https://github.com/patrickkirbyjr/ev-infrastructure-analysis) project analyzed the current infrastructure and identified charging station gaps in the most underbuilt states.

💊 Precision medicine fascinates me. I just love the idea of using technology to save lives. I explored this field of medicine by creating a [bioinformatics project](https://github.com/patrickkirbyjr/Drug-Potency-Predictor) that predicts drug potency based on specific combinations of drugs and genetic mutations in cancer cell lines.

🔬 I am currently working on building a [CNN](https://github.com/patrickkirbyjr/Colon-Cancer-CNN) to improve accuracy of colon cancer detection using histopathological images.
